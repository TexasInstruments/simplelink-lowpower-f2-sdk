/*
 * ======== Settings.syscfg.js ========
 * This module's main purpose is to provide a list of source files to
 * include in the BIOS 7.x's ti_sysbios_config.c file. The BIOS module
 * queries all modules in the system for a getCFiles function which provides
 * an array of files to include in the ti_sysbios_config.c file. This could
 * be generalized and move to ti.utils.build.GetCFiles or some such module.
