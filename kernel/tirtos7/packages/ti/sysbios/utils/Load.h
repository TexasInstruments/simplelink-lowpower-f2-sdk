 * @file Load.h
 * @brief The Load module reports execution times and load information for
 * threads in a system.
 *
 * SYS/BIOS manages four distinct levels of execution threads: hardware
 * interrupt service routines, software interrupt routines, tasks, and
 * background idle functions. This module reports execution time and load on a
 * per-task basis, and also provides information globally for hardware interrupt
 * service routines, software interrupt routines and idle functions (in the form
 * of the idle task). It can also report an estimate of the global CPU load.
 *
 * Execution time is reported in units of
 * Timestamp counts, and load is reported in percentages.
 *
 * By default, load data is gathered for Task threads. Load_hwiEnabled,
 * Load_swiEnabled and Load_taskEnabled
 * can be used to select which type(s) of threads are monitored.
 * Users can also choose to call @link Load_getTaskLoad @endlink,
 * @link Load_getGlobalSwiLoad @endlink, @link Load_getGlobalHwiLoad @endlink
 * and @link Load_getCPULoad @endlink at any time to obtain the statistics at
 * runtime.
 *
 * The module relies on @link Load_update @endlink to be called to compute load
 * and execution times from the time when @link Load_update @endlink was last
 * called. This is automatically done for every period specified by
 * Load_windowInMs in an Idle
 * function when Load_updateInIdle is set to true. The time
 * between two calls to @link Load_update @endlink is called the benchmark time
 * window.
 *
 * By passing in a function pointer of type void(*Load_postUpdate)(void)
 * through the Load_postUpdate config
 * parameter, one can specify a Load_postUpdate function that
 * is automatically called by @link Load_update @endlink immediately after the
 * statistics have been computed at the end of a benchmark time window.  Setting
 * this function allows the user to optionally post-process the thread
 * statistics once and only once per benchmark window.
 *
 * Advanced users could optionally omit calling @link Load_update @endlink in
 * the idle loop by setting Load_updateInIdle to false. They
 * can then call @link Load_update @endlink somewhere else (e.g. in a periodic
 * higher priority Task) instead to ensure statistics are computed even when the
 * system is never idle.
 *
 * <h3>CPU Load Calculation Methods</h3>
 *
 * The CPU load is computed in three different ways, depending on what threads
 * are monitored, and whether or not Power management is used to idle the CPU
 * when no threads are running.
 *
 * @htmlonly
 *  <B>Task Load Disabled and No Power Management</B>
 * @endhtmlonly
 *
 * The first method of calculating CPU load is used when Task load monitoring is
 * disabled, ie, Load_taskEnabled is false, and Power management
 * is not used. The CPU load is computed as the percentage of time in the
 * benchmark window which was NOT spent in the idle loop. More specifically, the
 * load is computed as follows:
 *
 * global CPU load = 100 * (1 - (min. time for a trip around idle loop * # times
 * in idle loop)/(benchmark time window) )
 *
 * Any work done in the idle loop is included in the CPU load - in other words,
 * any time spent in the loop beyond the shortest trip around the idle loop is
 * counted as non-idle time.
 *
 * This method works fairly well if the timestamp frequency is sufficiently high
 * (for example, if it's equal to the CPU frequency). The CPU load accuracy can
 * also be affected by caching and user idle functions.
 *
 * @htmlonly
 *  <B>Task Load Enabled and No Power Management</B>
 * @endhtmlonly
 *
 * The second method of calculating CPU load is used when Task load monitoring
 * is enabled (Load_taskEnabled = true) and Power management is not
 * used. In this case the CPU load is calculted as
 *
 * global CPU load = 100 - (Idle task load)
 *
 * This prevents any discrepancy between the calculated CPU load had we used the
 * first method, and 100 - the Idle task load.  If Swi and Hwi load monitoring
 * are not enabled, however, time spent in a Swi or Hwi will be charged to the
 * task in which it ran.  This will affect the accuracy of the CPU (and Task)
 * load, but the trade off is more overhead to do the Hwi and Swi load
 * monitoring.
 *
 * @htmlonly
 *  <B>Power Management Enabled</B>
 * @endhtmlonly
 *
 * The Load module is dependent on the timestamp timer, thus the latter must
 * continue to run during idle, in order to accurately measure idle and non-idle
 * time. On platforms where the timestamp timer is halted during sleep, the Load
 * module can only report correct numbers when power management is disabled. On
 * other platforms where the timer continues to run during sleep, the best way
 * to get CPU load is to make sure that Load_taskEnabled is set to true.  Then
 * the CPU load will be calculated as 100 - the idle task load.  However, for
 * BIOS in ROM builds, this method will not work, as Task hooks are not allowed.
 * So to use Load for any devices that support BIOS in ROM builds, make sure the
 * ROM build is disabled.
 *
 * <h3>Caveats</h3>
 *
 * - For the module to return accurate load values, the @link Load_update
 * @endlink function must be run at least once before the Timestamp count gets
 * to wrap around. This means on a platform with a 32-bit
 * Timestamp frequency that runs at 200 MHz, the
 * function must be called at least once every 21 sec. With faster
 * Timestamp frequencies it would have to be called
 * even more frequently.
 *
 * - If the Load_updateInIdle option is enabled, the module
 * will call @link Load_update @endlink periodically according to
 * Load_windowInMs. The latter must be set to a time interval that
 * is below (2^32) * 1000 / (Timestamp Frequency) milliseconds
 *
 * - If the Load_updateInIdle option is disabled, the user
 * is then responsible for calling @link Load_update @endlink more often than
 * the above time interval.
 *
 * - Load values might not add up to 100%. Because the module minimizes its
 * interrupt latency and avoids locking up the system to compute all thread
 * loads at once, each thread's execution time is evaluated separately over its
 * own time window, which could be slightly different to that of another thread.
 *
 * - When disabling monitoring of a thread type of higher priority, the time
 * spent in that thread type will be counted towards time spent in threads of
 * lower priority. E.g. if Load_hwiEnabled and
 * Load_swiEnabled are both false, then time spent in Hwi's and
 * Swi's will be counted towards the Tasks in which the interrupts happened.
 * Thus, for better accuracy, it is best to leave monitoring on for threads of a
 * higher priority relative to the thread type of interest.
 *
 * - When Task load monitoring is not enabled and Power management is not used,
 * the implementation of @link Load_getCPULoad() @endlink self-calibrates the
 * shortest path through the idle loop. It does this by keeping track of the
 * shortest time between invocations of an idle function automatically inserted
 * by the Load module, and assumes that to be the time it takes for one
 * iteration through the idle loop. Because of this, the CPU load value is only
 * an estimate since the idle loop might occasionally take longer to run (e.g.
 * due to caching effects, stalls). The reported CPU load tends to be slightly
 * higher than reality, especially when the load is low.
 *
 * - Currently does not support Timestamp frequencies over 4 GHz.
