 * @file ti/sysbios/BIOS.h
 * @brief SYS/BIOS Top-Level Manager
 *
 * This module is responsible for setting up global parameters pertaining to
 * SYS/BIOS and for performing the SYS/BIOS startup sequence.
 *
 * The SYS/BIOS startup sequence is logically divided into two phases: those
 * operations that occur prior to the application's "main()" function being
 * called, and those operations that are performed after the application's
 * "main()" function is invoked.
 *
 * The "before main()" startup sequence is governed completely by the
 * ti/sysbios/runtime/Startup module.
 *
 * The "after main()" startup sequence is governed by SYS/BIOS and is initiated
 * by an explicit call to the @link BIOS_start @endlink function at the end
 * of the application's main() function.
 *
 * Control points are provided at various places in each of the two startup
 * sequences for user startup operations to be inserted.
 *
 * The RTSC runtime startup sequence is as follows:
 *
 * - Immediately after CPU reset, perform target-specific CPU initialization
 * (beginning at c_int00).
 * - Prior to cinit(), run the user-supplied "reset functions"
 * - Run cinit() to initialize C runtime environment.
 * - Run the user-supplied "first functions"
 * - Run all the module initialization functions.
 * - Run pinit().
 * - Run the user-supplied "last functions"
 * - Run * main().
 *
 * The SYS/BIOS startup sequence begins at the end of main() when BIOS_start()
 * is called:
 *
 * - Run the user-supplied "startup functions"
 * - Enable Hardware Interrupts.
 * - Enable Software Interrupts. If the system supports Software Interrupts
 *   (Swis) (via the BIOS.swiEnabled configuration parameter), then the
 *   SYS/BIOS startup sequence enables Swis at this point.
 * - Timer Startup. If the system supports Timers, then at this point all
 *   statically configured timers are initialized per their user-configuration.
 *   If a timer was configured to start "automatically", it is started here.
 * - Task Startup. If the system supports Tasks (via the BIOS.taskEnabled
 *   configuration parameter), then task scheduling begins here. If
 *   there are no statically or dynamically created Tasks in the system, then
 *   execution proceeds directly to the Idle loop.
 *
 * @warning
 * Local variables defined in main() no longer exist once BIOS_start() is
 * called. The RAM where main's local variables reside is reassigned for use as
 * the interrupt stack during the execution of BIOS_start().
 *
 * Below is a configuration script excerpt that installs a user-supplied startup
 * function at every possible control point in the RTSC and SYS/BIOS startup
 * sequence:
 *
 * @code
 *  // get handle to xdc Startup module
 *  var Startup = xdc.useModule('xdc.runtime.Startup');
 *
 *  // install "reset function"
 *  Startup.resetFxn = '&myReset';
 *
 *  // install a "first function"
 *  var len = Startup.firstFxns.length
 *  Startup.firstFxns.length++;
 *  Startup.firstFxns[len] = '&myFirst';
 *
 *  // install a "last function"
 *  var len = Startup.lastFxns.length
 *  Startup.lastFxns.length++;
 *  Startup.lastFxns[len] = '&myLast';
 *
 *  // get handle to SYS/BIOS module
 *  var BIOS = xdc.useModule('ti.sysbios.BIOS');
 *
 *  // install a SYS/BIOS startup function
 *  BIOS.addUserStartupFunction('&myBiosStartup');

     * @brief Gate to make sure TI RTS library APIs are re-entrant
     *
     * The application gets to determine the type of gate (lock) that is used in
     * the TI RTS library. The gate will be used to guarantee re-entrancy of the
     * RTS APIs.
     *
     * The type of gate depends on the type of threads that are going to be
     * calling into the RTS library.  For example, if both Swi and Task threads
     * are going to be calling the RTS library's printf, GateSwi should be used.
     * In this case, Hwi threads are not impacted (i.e. disabled) during the
     * printf calls from the Swi or Task threads.
     *
     * If NoLocking is used, the RTS lock is not plugged and re-entrancy for the
     * TI RTS library calls are not guaranteed. The application can plug the RTS
     * locks directly if it wants.
     *
     * Numerous gate types are provided by SYS/BIOS.  Each has its advantages
     * and disadvantages.  The following list summarizes when each type is
     * appropriate for protecting an underlying non-reentrant RTS library.
     *
     * - @link BIOS_GateHwi @endlink: Interrupts are disabled and restored to
     * maintain re-entrancy. Use if only making RTS calls from a Hwi, Swi and/or
     * Task.
     *
     * - @link BIOS_GateSwi @endlink: Swis are disabled and restored to maintain
     * re-entrancy. Use if only making RTS calls from a Swi and/or Task.
     *
     * - @link BIOS_GateMutex @endlink: A single mutex is used to maintain re-
     * entrancy.  Use if only making RTS calls from a Task.  Blocks only Tasks
     * that are also trying to execute critical regions of RTS library.
     *
     * - @link BIOS_GateMutexPri @endlink: A priority inheriting mutex is used
     * to maintain re-entrancy. Blocks only Tasks that are also trying to
     * execute critical regions of RTS library.  Raises the priority of the Task
     * that is executing the critical region in the RTS library to the level of
     * the highest priority Task that is block by the mutex.
     *
     * The default value of rtsGateType depends on the type of threading model
     * enabled by other configuration parameters. If @link BIOS_taskEnabled
     * @endlink is true, @link BIOS_GateMutex @endlink is used. If @link
     * BIOS_swiEnabled @endlink is true and @link BIOS_taskEnabled @endlink is
     * false: @link BIOS_GateSwi @endlink is used. If both @link BIOS_swiEnabled
     * @endlink and @link BIOS_taskEnabled @endlink are false: @link
     * xdc.runtime#GateNull @endlink is used.
     *
     * If @link BIOS_taskEnabled @endlink is false, the user should not select
     * @link BIOS_GateMutex @endlink (or other Task level gates). Similarly, if
     * @link BIOS_taskEnabled @endlink and @link BIOS_swiEnabled @endlinkare
     * false, the user should not select @link BIOS_GateSwi @endlink or the Task
     * level gates.
