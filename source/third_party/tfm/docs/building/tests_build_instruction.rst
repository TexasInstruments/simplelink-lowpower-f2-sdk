Build Tests
###########

The tests is a TF-M application which verifies TF-M functionality on both SPE and NSPE sides.
Thus, tests require an extension of SPE side with test code and extra functionality
for some Non-Secure test cases. To inject that test code into SPE the
``CONFIG_TFM_TEST_DIR`` option is used. When SPE build system sees this option
it adds the corresponding folder via ``add_subdirectory(${CONFIG_TFM_TEST_DIR} tf-m-test)``
and includes it to SPE binary.
Also, test configurations should be passed to SPE build to include building Secure Tests.

To hide these complexities to developers, TF-M implements a wrapper CMake in **tf-m-tests**
repository [1]_ to build the SPE for testing rather than building it from the TF-M repository.

The recommended tf-m-tests repo commit to verify TF-M can be found at
``<TF-M source dir>/lib/ext/tf-m-tests/version.txt``.
It does not support auto-downloading as builds start from it.
You need to download it manually before building any tests with the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://git.trustedfirmware.org/TF-M/tf-m-tests.git
    git checkout <recommended tf-m-tests commit>

Regression Tests
================
For instructions on configuring, building and executing the regression tests
please refer to the documentation in **tf-m-tests** repository (to be added).
The regression test application is located under **/tests_reg** folder.
It is recommended to build both SPE and NSPE from that folder.

The basic commands for building the regression tests will be:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd </tf-m-tests/tests_reg>
    cmake -S spe -B build_spe -DTFM_PLATFORM=arm/mps2/an521 \
          -DCONFIG_TFM_SOURCE_PATH=<TF-M source dir> \
          -DTFM_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<Absolute path to>/toolchain_ARMCLANG.cmake \
          -DTEST_S=ON -DTEST_NS=ON
    cmake --build build_spe -- install

    cmake -S . -B build_test -DCONFIG_SPE_PATH=<Absolute path to>/build_spe/api_ns
    cmake --build build_test

Instead of enable all the supported Secure (``TEST_S``) and NS (``TEST_NS``) tests, you can also
enable individual test suites by using ``-DTEST_S_<SUITE>=ON`` or ``-DTEST_NS_<SUITE>=ON``.
For the available test suites, refer to the ``default_s_test_config.cmake`` and
``default_ns_test_config.cmake`` files in tf-m-tests repo.

.. Note::
    All the test suite config options should be passed to the SPE build command, including NS ones.
    The SPE building command also accepts all the other config options used to build a single TF-M.
    All options passing to SPE build does not have to be duplicated in NSPE build, including NS test
    suite config options.
    And this also applies to the below `PSA API tests`_.

PSA API tests
=============
PSA API tests from https://github.com/ARM-software/psa-arch-tests use the same
mechanism for SPE extension as the regression tests above utilising ``CONFIG_TFM_TEST_DIR`` option.
PSA API tests are selected by the TEST_PSA_API variable. Enabling both regression tests and
PSA API tests simultaneously is **not** supported.

TF-M implements a wrapper CMake for PSA API tests as well.
The PSA API test codes are located under **/tests_psa_arch** folder.

Here is a brief description of the basic flow:
Select one of the following test suites to be run.

.. code-block:: bash

    -DTEST_PSA_API=INTERNAL_TRUSTED_STORAGE
    -DTEST_PSA_API=PROTECTED_STORAGE
    -DTEST_PSA_API=STORAGE
    -DTEST_PSA_API=CRYPTO
    -DTEST_PSA_API=INITIAL_ATTESTATION
    -DTEST_PSA_API=IPC

Respectively for the corresponding service. For detailed information,
please refer to **PSA Certified APIs Architecture Test Suite** section [2]_
in the documentation of **psa-arch-tests** repository.

For example, to enable the PSA API tests for the Crypto service:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd </tf-m-tests/tests_psa_arch folder>
    cmake -S spe -B build_spe -DTFM_PLATFORM=arm/mps2/an521 -DCONFIG_TFM_SOURCE_PATH=<TF-M source dir>
          -DTEST_PSA_API=CRYPTO
    cmake --build build_spe -- install

    cmake -S . -B build_test -DCONFIG_SPE_PATH=<Absolute path to>/build_spe/api_ns
    cmake --build build_test
