Corstone SSE-300 with Ethos-U55/U65 Example Subsystem for Arm Ecosystem FVP and for MPS3 (AN547, AN552)
=======================================================================================================
Introduction
------------

Corstone-300 is an Arm reference subsystem for secure System on Chips
containing an Armv8.1-M Cortex-M55 processor and an Ethos-U55/U65 neural
network processor. It is an MPS3 based platform with the usual MPS3
peripherals.

This platform port supports all TF-M regression tests (Secure and Non-secure)
with Isolation Level 1 and 2.

.. note::

   For Ethos-U55/U65 IP this platform support only provides base address,
   interrupt number and an example NPU setup as non-secure, unprivileged.

.. note::

   For Armclang compiler v6.18 or later version is required.

Building TF-M
-------------

Follow the instructions in :doc:`Building instructions </building/tfm_build_instruction>`.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Build instructions with platform name: arm/mps3/corstone300/an547
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
``-DTFM_PLATFORM=arm/mps3/corstone300/an547``

.. note::

   For Ethos-U55/U65 IP this platform support only provides base address,
   interrupt number and an example NPU setup as non-secure, unprivileged.

Build instructions with platform name: arm/mps3/corstone300/an552
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
``-DTFM_PLATFORM=arm/mps3/corstone300/an552``

.. note::

   For Ethos-U55/U65 IP this platform support only provides base address,
   interrupt number and an example NPU setup as non-secure, unprivileged.

Build instructions with platform name: arm/mps3/corstone300/fvp
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
``-DTFM_PLATFORM=arm/mps3/corstone300/fvp``

.. note::

   For Ethos-U55/U65 IP this platform support only provides base address,
   interrupt number and an example NPU setup as non-secure, unprivileged.

.. note::

   The built binaries can be run on the Corstone-300 Ethos-U55/U65 Ecosystem FVP
   (FVP_SSE300_MPS3). At least Ecosystem FVP version 11.22 is required.

.. note::

   Provisioning bundles can be generated with the ``-DPLATFORM_DEFAULT_PROVISIONING=OFF``
   flag. The provisioning bundle binary will be generated and it's going to contain the
   provisioning code and provisioning values.

.. note::

   If ``-DPLATFORM_DEFAULT_PROVISIONING=OFF`` and ``-DTFM_DUMMY_PROVISIONING=ON`` then the keys in
   the ``tf-m/platform/ext/target/arm/mps3/common/provisioning/provisioning_config.cmake`` and the
   default MCUBoot signing keys will be used for provisioning.

   If ``-DPLATFORM_DEFAULT_PROVISIONING=OFF`` and ``-DTFM_DUMMY_PROVISIONING=OFF`` are set
   then unique values can be used for provisioning. The keys and seeds can be changed by
   passing the new values to the build command, or by setting the ``-DPROVISIONING_KEYS_CONFIG`` flag
   to a .cmake file that contains the keys. An example config cmake file can be seen at
   ``tf-m/platform/ext/target/arm/mps3/common/provisioning/provisioning_config.cmake``.
   Otherwise new random values are going to be generated and used. For the image signing
   the ${MCUBOOT_KEY_S} and ${MCUBOOT_KEY_NS} will be used. These variables should point to
   .pem files that contain the code signing private keys. The public keys are going to be generated
   from these private keys and will be used for provisioning. The hash of the public key is going to
   be written into the ``provisioning_data.c`` automatically.

   If ``-DMCUBOOT_GENERATE_SIGNING_KEYPAIR=ON`` is set then a new mcuboot signing public and private
   keypair is going to be generated and it's going to be used to sign the S and NS binaries.

   The new generated keypair can be found in the ``<build dir>/bin`` folder or in the
   ``<install directory>/image_signing/keys`` after installation.
   The generated provisioning_data.c file can be found at
   ``<build directory>/platform/target/provisioning/provisioning_data.c``

.. note::

   The provisioning bundle generation depends on pyelftools that's have to be installed::

    pip3 install pyelftools

FPGA image is available to download `here <https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/development-boards/fpga-prototyping-boards/download-fpga-images>`__

If the link above is not working just go to `Arm PDH <https://developer.arm.com/downloads>`__ and search for AN547.

To run BL2 bootloader, TF-M example application and tests in the MPS3 board,
it is required to have AN547 image in the MPS3 board SD card. The image should
be located in ``<MPS3 device name>/MB/HBI<BoardNumberBoardrevision>/AN547``

The MPS3 board tested is HBI0309C.

#. Copy ``bl2.bin`` and ``tfm_s_ns_signed.bin`` files from
   build dir to ``<MPS3 device name>/SOFTWARE/``
#. Rename ``tfm_s_ns_signed.bin`` to ``tfm.bin`` (Filename should not be longer
   than 8 charachters.)
#. Open ``<MPS3 device name>/MB/HBI0309C/AN547/images.txt``
#. Update the ``images.txt`` file as follows::
