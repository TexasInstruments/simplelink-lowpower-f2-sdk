Corstone SSE-310 with Ethos-U55/U65 Example Subsystem for Arm Ecosystem FVP and for MPS3 (AN555)
================================================================================================

Introduction
------------

Corstone-310 (formerly Corstone-Polaris) is an Arm reference subsystem for
secure System on Chips containing an Armv8.1-M Cortex-M85 processor and an
Ethos-U55/U65 neural network processor. It is an MPS3 based platform with the
usual MPS3 peripherals.

This platform port supports all TF-M regression tests (Secure and Non-secure)
with Isolation Level 1 and 2.

.. note::

   For Ethos-U55/U65 IP this platform support only provides base address,
   interrupt number and an example NPU setup as non-secure, unprivileged.

.. note::

   For Armclang compiler v6.18 or later version is required.

Building TF-M
-------------

Follow the instructions in :doc:`Building instructions </building/tfm_build_instruction>`.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Build instructions with platform name: arm/mps3/corstone310/an555
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
``-DTFM_PLATFORM=arm/mps3/corstone310/an555``

.. note::

   For Ethos-U55/U65 IP this platform support only provides base address,
   interrupt number and an example NPU setup as non-secure, unprivileged.


Build instructions with platform name: arm/mps3/corstone310/fvp
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
``-DTFM_PLATFORM=arm/mps3/corstone310/fvp``

.. note::

   For Ethos-U55/U65 IP this platform support only provides base address,
   interrupt number and an example NPU setup as non-secure, unprivileged.

.. note::

   The built binaries can be run on the Corstone-310 Ethos-U55/U65 Ecosystem FVP
   (FVP_SSE310_MPS3). At least Ecosystem FVP version 11.22 is required.

.. note::

   Provisioning bundles can be generated with the ``-DPLATFORM_DEFAULT_PROVISIONING=OFF``
   flag. The provisioning bundle binary will be generated and it's going to contain the
   provisioning code and provisioning values.

.. note::

   If ``-DPLATFORM_DEFAULT_PROVISIONING=OFF`` and ``-DTFM_DUMMY_PROVISIONING=ON`` then the keys in
   the ``tf-m/platform/ext/target/arm/mps3/common/provisioning/provisioning_config.cmake`` and the
   default MCUBoot signing keys will be used for provisioning.

   If ``-DPLATFORM_DEFAULT_PROVISIONING=OFF`` and ``-DTFM_DUMMY_PROVISIONING=OFF`` are set
   then unique values can be used for provisioning. The keys and seeds can be changed by
   passing the new values to the build command, or by setting the ``-DPROVISIONING_KEYS_CONFIG`` flag
   to a .cmake file that contains the keys. An example config cmake file can be seen at
   ``tf-m/platform/ext/target/arm/mps3/common/provisioning/provisioning_config.cmake``.
   Otherwise new random values are going to be generated and used. For the image signing
   the ${MCUBOOT_KEY_S} and ${MCUBOOT_KEY_NS} will be used. These variables should point to
   .pem files that contain the code signing private keys. The public keys are going to be generated
   from these private keys and will be used for provisioning. The hash of the public key is going to
   be written into the ``provisioning_data.c`` automatically.

   If ``-DMCUBOOT_GENERATE_SIGNING_KEYPAIR=ON`` is set then a new mcuboot signing public and private
   keypair is going to be generated and it's going to be used to sign the S and NS binaries.


   The new generated keypair can be found in the ``<build dir>/bin`` folder or in the
   ``<install directory>/image_signing/keys`` after installation.
   The generated provisioning_data.c file can be found at
   ``<build directory>/platform/target/provisioning/provisioning_data.c``

.. note::

   The provisioning bundle generation depends on pyelftools that's have to be installed::

    pip3 install pyelftools

To run the example code on Corstone SSE-310 with Ethos-U55/U65 Example Subsystem for MPS3 (AN555)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FPGA image is available to download `here <https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/development-boards/fpga-prototyping-boards/download-fpga-images>`__

If the link above is not working just go to `Arm PDH <https://developer.arm.com/downloads>`__ and search for AN555.

To run BL2 bootloader, TF-M example application and tests in the MPS3 board,
it is required to have AN555 image in the MPS3 board SD card. The image should
be located in ``<MPS3 device name>/MB/HBI<BoardNumberBoardrevision>/AN555``

The MPS3 board tested is HBI0309C.

#. Execute the following command to create the tfm.bin binary
   which fills the entire available space on the MPS3 onboard QSPI.
   This way the whole flash content (PS, ITS, OTP, NV counters) is in a known state.
   (If anything left in the QSPI, this binary will overwrite it.)
   Also, MPS3 can only handle SFN 8.3 format, so the binary name must be shortened.::

   $ cd <build dir>/bin
   $ cp tfm_s_ns_signed.bin tfm.bin
   $ truncate -s 8M tfm.bin

#. Copy ``bl2.bin`` and ``tfm.bin`` files from
   build dir to ``<MPS3 device name>/SOFTWARE/``
#. Open ``<MPS3 device name>/MB/HBI0309C/AN555/images.txt``
#. Update the ``images.txt`` file as follows::

    [IMAGES]
    TOTALIMAGES: 2

    IMAGE0ADDRESS: 0x01_00_1100_0000
    IMAGE0UPDATE: RAM
    IMAGE0FILE: \SOFTWARE\bl2.bin

    IMAGE1ADDRESS: 0x01_00_0000_0000
    IMAGE1UPDATE: FORCEQSPI
    IMAGE1FILE: \SOFTWARE\tfm.bin

#. Close ``<MPS3 device name>/MB/HBI0309C/AN555/images.txt``
#. Unmount/eject the ``<MPS3 device name>`` unit
#. Reset the board to execute the TF-M example application
#. After completing the procedure you should be able to visualize on the serial
   port (baud 115200 8n1) the following messages::

    [INF] Starting bootloader
    [INF] Beginning BL2 provisioning
    [WRN] TFM_DUMMY_PROVISIONING is not suitable for production! This device is NOT SECURE

    TF-M isolation level is: 0x00000001

.. note::

   Some of the messages above are only visible when ``CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`` is set
   to ``Debug``.

.. note::

   If ``-DPLATFORM_DEFAULT_PROVISIONING=OFF`` is set then the provisioning bundle has to
   be placed on the ``0x11022400`` address by copying ``encrypted_provisioning_bundle.bin`` and
   renaming it to ``prv.bin``, then extending the images.txt with::

    IMAGE2UPDATE: RAM
    IMAGE2ADDRESS: 0x01_00_1102_2400
    IMAGE2FILE: \SOFTWARE\prv.bin

To run the example code on Corstone-310 Ethos-U55/U65 Ecosystem FVP
-------------------------------------------------------------------
FVP is available to download `here <https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/arm-platforms-software/arm-ecosystem-fvps>`__

#. Install the FVP
#. Copy ``bl2.axf`` and ``tfm_s_ns_signed.bin`` files from
   build dir to ``<FVP installation path>/models/Linux64_GCC-9.3/``
#. Navigate to the same directory and execute the following command to start FVP::

    $ ./FVP_Corstone_SSE-310 -a cpu0*="bl2.axf" --data "tfm_s_ns_signed.bin"@0x38000000

#. After completing the procedure you should be able to see similar messages
   to this on the serial port (baud 115200 8n1)::
