 *
 *  @brief      Dual Mode Policy Manager
 *
 *  The DMMPolicy interface provides a service to for the stack applications to
 *  update the priority of the stack activities, which is then used to make scheduling decisions.
 *
 *  # Fields in the Policy Table #
 *  .state: the name of the application state
 *  .weight: amount of adjusted priority for stack activities specified in .appliedActivity
 *  .timingConstraint: reserved for future usage
 *  .pause: whether or not the specified stack's application is paused during the state
 *  .appliedActivity: Specified the activities of which priority is/are adjusted by .weight
 *    - Final Priority = GPT (Stack level priority) +  weight (Application Level)
 *  .balancedMode: Switch the .weight value between the two stacks based on the time information specified
 *
 *  # Usage #
 *
 *  To use the DMMPolicy module to set the scheduling policy, the application
 *  calls the following APIs:
 *    - DMMPolicy_init(): Initialize the DMMPolicy module/task.
 *    - DMMPolicy_Params_init():  Initialize a DMMPolicy_Params structure
 *      with default values.  Then change the parameters from non-default
 *      values as needed.
 *    - DMMPolicy_open():  Open an instance of the DMMPolicy module,
 *      passing the initialized parameters.
 *    - Stack A/B application - DMMPolicy_updateApplicationState: Update the application state.
 *                              The Policy Manager finds the matching policy that is used
 *                              when scheduling RF commands from stack A and B.
 *
 *   An example of a policy table (define in ti_dmm_application_policy.c, which is generated by SysConfig)
 *
 *   \code

 *           .appliedActivity =  DMMPOLICY_APPLIED_ACTIVITY_BLE_CONNECTION,
 *            (note: the priority of BLE connection event is increased by .weight (25) during BLE_OAD)
 *       },
