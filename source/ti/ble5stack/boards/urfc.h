 *  @brief This file contains configurable variables for the Micro BLE Stack
 *  radio.
 *
 *  In general, the configuration values vary by device type, device version
 *  and board characteristics. The definitions and values listed in
 *  urfcfg.h and urfcfg.c can be changed or more sets of definitions and
 *  values can be added, depending on which version/type of device and what
 *  characteristics the board has.
 *
 *  @note User configurable variables except the elements of
 *  the power table are only used during the initialization
 *  of the MAC. Changing the values of these variables
 *  except power table elements after this will have no
 *  effect.

// Device Package and Evaluation Module (EM) Board

// The CC26xx device comes in three types of packages: 7x7, 5x5, 4x4.
// For each package, the user may change how the RF Front End (FE) is
// configured. The possible FE settings are provided as a set of defines.
// (The user can also set the FE bias, the settings of which are also provided
// as defines.) The user can change the value of RF_FE_MODE_AND_BIAS to
// configure the RF FE as desired. However, while setting the FE configuration
// determines how the device is configured at the package, it is the PCB the
// device is mounted on (the EM) that determines how those signals are routed.
// So while the FE is configurable, how signals are used is fixed by the EM.
// As can be seen, the value of RF_FE_MODE_AND_BIAS is organized by the EM
// board as defined by EMs produced by Texas Instruments Inc. How the device
// is mounted, routed, and configured for a user product would of course be
// user defined, and the value of RF_FE_MODE_AND_BIAS would have to be set
// accordingly; the user could even dispense with the conditional board
// compiles entirely. So too with the usage of the Tx Power tables. As can be
// seen in bleUserConfig.c, there are two tables, one for packages using a
// differential FE, and one for single-end. This too has been organized by TI
// defined EMs and would have to be set appropriately by the user.
//
// For example:
// Let's say you decided to build several boards using the CC26xx 4x4 package.
// For one board, you plan to use a differential RF FE, while on the other you
// wish to use a single ended RFN RF FE. You would then create your own board.h
// (located by your preprocessor Include path name) that contains one of two
// defines that you create (say MY_CC26xx_4ID and MY_CC26xx_4XS). Then you can
// define your own choice of RF FE conditionally based on these defines
// (completely replacing those shown below), as follows:
//
//#if defined(MY_CC26xx_4ID)
//
//  #define RF_FE_MODE_AND_BIAS           (RF_FE_DIFFERENTIAL |               \
//                                          RF_FE_INT_BIAS)
//#elif defined(MY_CC26xx_4XS)
//
//  #define RF_FE_MODE_AND_BIAS           (RF_FE_SINGLE_ENDED_RFN |           \
//                                          RF_FE_EXT_BIAS)
//#else // unknown device package
// :
//
// In this way, you can define your own board I/O settings, and configure your
// RF FE based on your own board defines.
//
// For additional details and examples, please see the Software Developer's
// Guide.
