 @brief Watchdog driver implementation for CC26XX

        # Driver include #
        The Watchdog header file for CC26XX should be included in an application
        as follows:
        @code
        #include <ti/drivers/Watchdog.h>
        #include <ti/drivers/watchdog/WatchdogCC26XX.h>
        @endcode

        # Overview #
        ## Note that the watchdog driver has not been fully validated, and thus should be considered experimental. ##

        The general SPI API should be used in application code, i.e. SPI_open()
        should be used instead of SPICC26XXDMA_open(). The board file will define the device
        specific config, and casting in the general API will ensure that the correct
        device specific functions are called.

        # General Behavior #
        This Watchdog driver implementation is designed to operate on a CC26XX
        device. Once opened, CC26XX Watchdog will count down from the reload
        value specified in the WatchdogCC26XX_HWAttrs. If it times out, the
        Watchdog interrupt flag will be set, and a user-provided callback function
        will be called. If resets have been enabled in the Watchdog_Params and
        the Watchdog Timer is allowed to time out again while the interrupt flag is
        still pending, a reset signal will be generated. To prevent a reset,
        Watchdog_clear() must be called to clear the interrupt flag.

        The reload value from which the Watchdog Timer counts down may be changed
        during runtime using Watchdog_setReload().

        Watchdog_close() is <b>not</b> supported by this driver implementation.

        By default the Watchdog driver has resets turned on. However, they may be
        turned off in the Watchdog_Params which allows the Watchdog Timer to be
        used like another timer interrupt. This functionality is <b>not</b> supported by
        all platforms, refer to device specific documentation for details.

        Tbd

        # Power Management #
        Tbd

        # Supported Functions #
        Tbd

        # Use Cases #
        To have a user-defined function run at the warning interrupt, first define
        a void-type function that takes a Watchdog_Handle cast to a UArg as an
        argument such as the one shown below.

        @code
        void callback(UArg handle);

        ...

        Watchdog_Handle handle;
        Watchdog_Params params;

        Watchdog_Params_init(&params);
        params.callbackFxn = callback;
        handle = Watchdog_open(Watchdog_configIndex, &params);
        @endcode
