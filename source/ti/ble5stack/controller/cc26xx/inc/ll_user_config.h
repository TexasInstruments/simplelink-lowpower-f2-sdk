 @file  ll_user_config.h

 @brief This file contains user configurable variables for the BLE
        Controller.

        To change the default value of configurable variable:
          - Include "ll_userConfig.h" in your OSAL_ICallBle.c file.
          - Set the variables at the start of stack_main. Actually,
            it is okay to set the variables anywhere in stack_main
            as long as it is BEFORE osal_init_system, but best to
            set at the very start of stack_main.

        Note: User configurable variables are only used during the
              initialization of the Controller. Changing the values
              of these variables after this will have no effect.

        For example:
          int stack_main()
          {
            // user reconfiguration of Controller variables
            llUserConfig.maxNumConns  = 1;
            llUserConfig.numTxEntries = 10;
                       :

        Default values:
          maxNumConns  : 3
          numTxEntries : 6

 Group: WCS, BTS
 Target Device: cc13xx_cc26xx
