We can achieve 32 connections running out of box simple_central project. \n
To enable this functionality choose Guard Time.\n

__Note__: The only way to prevent RxBuf overflow is to enable NPI_FLOW_CTRL. If the buffer \
has overflowed there is no way to safely recover. All received bytes can be packet fragments \
so if a packet fragment is lost the frame parser behavior becomes undefined.\n
If NPI_FLOW_CTRL is not enabled then  the peripheral cannot control the central's transfer rate. \
With NPI_FLOW_CTRL the peripheral has SRDY to use as a software flow control mechanism.\n
When using NPI_FLOW_CTRL make sure to increase NPI_TL_BUF_SIZE to suit the NPI frame length \
that is expected to be received.\n

 software application to support direct test mode without exposing the HCI to the UART\
 pins under normal operation.\n
 __Note__: The pins used for PTM can also be used for an application UART interface.\
 In this case, it is necessary to ensure that the other device that is connected to the\
 UART interface does not run at the same time that DTM is being exercised. If the device\
 powers up and goes into PTM mode (by a GPIO being held high or low or some other stimulus),\
 the UART will then be used for DTM commands. If the device powers up normally and does\
 not go into PTM mode, then the UART can be initialized by the application and used to\
 communicate with the other device. DTM commands can also be called by the embedded BLE\
 application.\n
