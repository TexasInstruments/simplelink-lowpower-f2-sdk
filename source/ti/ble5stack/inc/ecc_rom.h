/*
 * Function:    ECC_initialize
 *
 * Description: pass pointer to ECC memory allocation to ECC engine.  This
 *              function can be called again to point the ECC workzone at
 *              a different memory buffer.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *              pWorkzone  - pointer to memory allocated for computations, input.
 *                           See description at beginning of ECC section for
 *                           memory requirements.
 *              windowSize - operation window, determines speed vs RAM tradeoff.
 *                           2 is the most RAM efficient and slowest.  5 is
 *                           quickest but with the greatest RAM tradeoff.
 *
 * Return:      None

 *
 * Parameters:
 *              randString  - random string, input.
 *
 *              privateKey  - the private key, output.
 *              publicKey_x - public key X-coordinate, output.
