 *  # Header Include #
 *  The external flash layout file should be included in an OAD enabled
 *  application as follows:
 *  @code
 *  #include <common/cc26xx/oad/ext_flash_layout.h>
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  # Overview #
 *
 *  The OAD external flash header is used to build up a table of all images that
 *  currently reside in external flash, and gives the OAD user application a way
 *  to easily collect information about the images. More information about the
 *  external flash header and the external flash layout can be found in the
 *  Over the Air Download (OAD) section of your protocol stack's User Guide.
