 *  @brief      Temperature driver
 *
 *  @anchor ti_drivers_Temperature_Overview
 *  # Overview #
 *  The Temperature driver provides services related to measuring and reacting
 *  to the current temperature of the chip and changes to it.
 *
 *  The two main services provided are:
 *      - Getting the current temperature
 *      - Providing notification callbacks when the temperature changes
 *
 *  @anchor ti_drivers_Temperature_Usage
 *  # Usage #
 *
 *  ## Initialisation #
 *  Unlike most drivers, there is only a single instance of the temperature
 *  driver that is always available once #Temperature_init() is called.
 *  #Temperature_init() should be called once before using other Temperature
 *  driver APIs. It is not called automatically via SysConfig generated code.
 *  Subsequent #Temperature_init() calls will have no effect.
 *
 *  ## Getting the Current Temperature #
 *  The most basic function of the driver is to provide the current temperature
 *  and return it. It is encoded as a signed integer in degrees C.
 *
 *  ## Notifications #
 *  The other major function of the Temperature driver is to notify the
 *  application when the temperature changes and crosses an application-defined
 *  threshold.
 *
 *  There are three default usecases for this:
 *      - High threshold.
 *        The application will receive a notification callback when
 *        currentTemperature >= thresholdHigh.
 *      - Low threshold.
 *        The application will receive a notification callback when
 *        currentTemperature <= thresholdLow.
 *      - Range threshold.
 *        The application will receive a notification callback when
 *        currentTemperature >= thresholdHigh || currentTemperature <=
 *        thresholdLow. This setup addresses usecases
 *        where a notification is required when the temperature changes by a
 *        certain amount regardless of whether it is up or down. Adjusting
 *        clock offsets based on temperature is a good example of this.
 *
 *  ### Registering Notifications
 *  There are three functions that register a notification for the application:
 *      - #Temperature_registerNotifyHigh()
 *      - #Temperature_registerNotifyLow()
 *      - #Temperature_registerNotifyRange()
 *
 *  Multiple notifications may be registered. The different parts of the
 *  application and drivers that need to respond to a temperature change do not
 *  need to know of one another.
 *  Each notification must have its own #Temperature_NotifyObj and must be
 *  registered individually.
 *
 *  ### Notification Callbacks
 *  Once the chip temperature crosses the smallest high threshold or largest
 *  low threshold amongst the registered notifications, the driver will
 *  iterate over the entire list of registered notification and check which
 *  ones have triggered. Notifications that have triggered are removed from
 *  the list of registered notifications and thus are no longer registered.
 *  Their callback function is then invoked.
 *
 *  If an application wishes to re-register a notification that just triggered
 *  and was unregistered, it may register it again from within the notification
 *  callback or another context.
 *
 *  It is possible to determine whether the high or low threshold triggered
 *  the notification callback as follows:
 *      - currentTemperature <= thresholdTemperature: Low threshold triggered
 *      - currentTemperature >= thresholdTemperature: High threshold triggered
 *  This information is only reasonably useful when registering a notification
 *  with both a high and low threshold using #Temperature_registerNotifyRange().
 *  Even then, the expected basic usecase only cares about the current
 *  temperature and adding an offset to it when registering the notification
 *  again.
 *
 *  ### Unregistering Notifications
 *  Registered notifications are unregistered in two ways:
 *      - Automatically when a notification triggers
 *      - By calling #Temperature_unregisterNotify()
 *
 *  Unregistered notifications may be registered again at any time.
 *
 *  # Measured vs True Temperature
 *  While the driver aims to supply and act on an accurate absolute temperature,
 *  there will be differences between the measured vs the true temperature due
 *  to inherent variances in the manufacturing process. The nature of these
 *  differences varies by device family.
 *
 *  Examples of such differences:
 *      - A constant per-chip offset between the measured and the true
 *        temperature
 *      - An temperature dependent per-chip offset between the measured and the
 *        true temperature
 *      - A variance in the measured temperature when measuring multiple times
 *        at the same chip temperature
 *
 *  It is strongly recommended to read the device-specific Temperature driver
 *  documentation for details of the temperature sensor characteristics and
 *  how they might affect choices of threshold values.
