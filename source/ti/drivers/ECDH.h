 * @brief TI Driver for Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key agreement scheme.
 *
 * @anchor ti_drivers_ECDH_Overview
 * # Overview #
 *
 * Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) is a key agreement scheme between
 * two parties based on the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol.
 *
 * It provides a means of generating a shared secret and derived symmetric key
 * between the two parties over an insecure channel.
 *
 * It does not provide authentication. As such, it does not guarantee that the
 * party you are exchanging keys with is truly the party you wish to establish a
 * secured channel with.
 *
 * The two parties each generate a private key and a public key. The private key
 * is a random integer in the interval [1, n - 1], where n is the order of a
 * previously agreed upon curve. The public key is generated
 * by multiplying the private key by the generator point of a previously agreed
 * upon elliptic curve such as NISTP256 or Curve 25519. The public key is itself
 * a point upon the elliptic curve. Each public key is then transmitted to the
 * other party over a potentially insecure channel. The other party's public key
 * is then multiplied with the private key, generating a shared secret. This
 * shared secret is also a point on the curve. However, the entropy in the secret
 * is not spread evenly throughout the shared secret. In order to generate one or more
 * shared symmetric keys, the shared secret must be run through a key derivation
 * function (KDF) that was previously agreed upon. Usually, only the X coordinate
 * is processed in this way as it contains all the entropy of the shared secret and
 * some curve implementations only provide the X coordinate. The key derivation function
 * can take many forms, from simply hashing the X coordinate of the shared secret
 * with SHA2 and truncating the result to generating multiple symmetric keys with
 * HKDF, an HMAC based KDF.
 *
 * Key derivation functions in the context of symmetric key generation after
 * elliptic curve based key exchange differ from KDFs used to generate keys from
 * passwords a user provides in a login. Those KDFs such as bcrypt purposefully
 * add additional computation to increase a system's resistance against brute
 * force or dictionary attacks.
 *
 * @anchor ti_drivers_ECDH_Usage
 * # Usage #
 *
 * ## Before starting an ECDH operation #
 *
 * Before starting an ECDH operation, the application must do the following:
 *      - Call ECDH_init() to initialize the driver
 *      - Call ECDH_Params_init() to initialize the ECDH_Params to default values.
 *      - Modify the ECDH_Params as desired
 *      - Call ECDH_open() to open an instance of the driver
 *
 * ## Generating your public-private key pair #
 * To generate a public-private key pair for an agreed upon curve, the application
 * must do the following:
 *      - Generate the keying material for the private key. This keying material must
 *        be an integer in the interval [1, n - 1], where n is the order of the curve.
 *        It can be stored in big-endian or little-endian format.
 *        The array should be the same length as the curve parameters of the curve used.
 *        The driver validates private keys against the provided curve by default.
 *      - Initialize the private key CryptoKey. CryptoKeys are opaque data structures and representations
 *        of keying material and its storage. Depending on how the keying material
 *        is stored (RAM or flash, key store), the CryptoKey must be
 *        initialized differently. The ECDH API can handle all types of CryptoKey.
 *        However, not all device-specific implementations support all types of CryptoKey.
 *        Devices without a key store will not support CryptoKeys with keying material
 *        stored in a key store for example.
 *        All devices support plaintext CryptoKeys.
 *      - Initialize a blank CryptoKey for the public key. The CryptoKey will keep track
 *        of where the keying material for the public key should be copied and how
 *        long it is. SEC 1-based big-endian format public keys should have key material twice the length
 *        of the private key plus one. Little-endian format public keys should have key material the
 *        length of the private key for Montgomery curve X-only public keys or have key material twice
 *        the length of the private for other curves
 *      - Initialize the ECDH_OperationGeneratePublicKey struct and then populate it. By
 *        default, big-endian public keys will be generated.
 *      - If using RFC 7748-style public keys, initialize the operation's public key
 *        data format to be ECDH_LITTLE_ENDIAN_KEY.
 *      - Call ECDH_generatePublicKey(). The generated keying material will be copied
 *        according the the CryptoKey passed in as the public key parameter. The CryptoKey
 *        will no longer be considered 'blank' after the operation.
 *
 * ## Calculating a shared secret #
 * After trading public keys with the other party, the application should do the following
 * to calculate the shared secret:
 *      - Initialize a CryptoKey as public key with the keying material received from the other
 *        party.
 *      - Initialize the private key CryptoKey with the key used to generate your
 *        public key. CryptoKeys are opaque data structures and representations
 *        of keying material and its storage. Depending on how the keying material
 *        is stored (RAM or flash, key store), the CryptoKey must be
 *        initialized differently. The ECDH API can handle all types of CryptoKey.
 *        However, not all device-specific implementations support all types of CryptoKey.
 *        Devices without a key store will not support CryptoKeys with keying material
 *        stored in a key store for example.
 *        All devices support plaintext CryptoKeys.
 *      - Initialize a blank CryptoKey with the same size as the previously initialized
 *        public key.
 *      - Initialize the ECDH_OperationComputeSharedSecret struct and then populate it. By
 *        default, big-endian input keys will be assumed and big-endian shared secrets
 *        will be generated.
 *      - If importing RFC 7748-style public keys, initialize the operation's key material
 *        endianess to be ECDH_LITTLE_ENDIAN_KEY.
 *      - Call ECDH_computeSharedSecret(). The shared secret will be copied to a location
 *        according to the shared secret CryptoKey passed to the function call. The driver
 *        will validate the supplied public key and reject invalid ones.
 *
 * ## Creating one or more symmetric keys from the shared secret #
 * After calculating the shared secret between the application and the other party,
 * the entropy in the shared secret must be evened out and stretched as needed. There are
 * uncountable methods and algorithms to stretch an original seed entropy (the share secret)
 * to generate symmetric keys.
 *      - Run the X coordinate of the resulting entropy through a key derivation function (KDF)
 *
 * ## After a key exchange #
 * After the ECDH key exchange completes, the application should either start another operation
 * or close the driver by calling ECDH_close()
 *
 * ## General usage #
 * The API expects elliptic curves as defined in ti/drivers/cryptoutils/ecc/ECCParams.h.
 * Several commonly used curves are provided. Check the device-specific ECDH documentation
 * for curve type (short Weierstrass, Montgomery, Edwards) support for your device.
 * ECDH support for a curve type on a device does not imply curve-type support for
 * other ECC schemes.
 *
 * ## Key Formatting
 * By default, the ECDH API expects the private and public keys to be formatted in
 * big-endian format. The details of octet string formatting can be found in
 * SEC 1: Elliptic Curve Cryptography.
 *
 * ## Limitations #
 * For CC27XX devices, the ECDH driver cannot accept private keys with a
 * value of 0x01 (entire value is 0x01).
 *
 * Private keys can be formatted as big-endian or little-endian integers of the same
 * length as the curve length.
 *
 * Public keys and shared secrets are points on an elliptic curve. These points can
 * be expressed in several ways. The most common one is in affine coordinates as an
 * X,Y pair.
 * This API uses points expressed in uncompressed affine coordinates by default.
 * The big-endian format requires a formatting byte in the first byte of the
 * public key. When using uncompressed affine coordinates, this is the value
 * 0x04.
 * The point itself is stored as a concatenated array of X followed by Y.
 * X and Y maybe in big-endian or little-endian. Some implementations do not require or
 * yield the Y coordinate for ECDH on certain curves. It is recommended that the full
 * keying material buffer of twice the curve param length is used to facilitate
 * code-reuse. Implementations that do not use the Y coordinate will zero-out
 * the Y-coordinate whenever they write a point to the CryptoKey.
 *
 * If device-supported, Montgomery curves can be stored as their X-only format
 * based on the RFC-7748 specification. Here, only the X coordinate is packed
 * in little-endian integers of the same length as the curve length.
 *
 * This API accepts and returns the keying material of public keys according
 * to the following table:
 *
 * | Curve Type         | Keying Material Array | Array Length               |
 * |--------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|
 * | Short Weierstrass  | [0x04, X, Y]          | 1 + 2 * Curve Param Length |
 * | Montgomery         | [0x04, X, Y]          | 1 + 2 * Curve Param Length |
 * | Montgomery         | [X]                   | Curve Param Length         |
 * | Edwards            | [0x04, X, Y]          | 1 + 2 * Curve Param Length |
 *
 * Note: This driver will automatically prune the private key according to
 *       RFC 7748 for the following curve:
 *           X25519
