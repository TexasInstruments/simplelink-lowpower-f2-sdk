 * @brief TI Driver for Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm.
 *
 *
 * @anchor ti_drivers_ECDSA_Overview
 * # Overview #
 *
 * The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) is a message
 * authentication scheme between two parties based on operation on elliptic
 * curves over finite fields.
 *
 * Signing a message with ECDSA proves to the recipient that the sender of
 * the message is in possession of the private key corresponding to the
 * transmitted public key used during verification.
 * For most practical systems, this ensures message authentication and
 * integrity.
 *
 * # Steps involved #
 *  - The sender hashes the message they wish to authenticate and
 *    truncates it to the length of the curve parameters of the
 *    elliptic curve used by both parties.
 *  - The sender generates r and s where 0 < r, s < N. These two integers
 *    constitute the actual signature of the message.
 *  - The sender transmits the message, r, s, and the public key to the
 *    recipient.
 *  - The recipient calculates the hash of the message using an agreed
 *    upon hash function and truncates it to the length of the curve
 *    parameters of the elliptic curve used by both parties
 *  - The recipient uses the hash, s, and the sender's public key to
 *    recalculate r.
 *  - The recipient accepts the signature if the received and calculated r
 *    match. Otherwise, they reject the signature.
 *
 * @anchor ti_drivers_ECDSA_Usage
 * # Usage #
 *
 * ## Before starting an ECDSA operation #
 *
 * Before starting an ECDSA operation, the application must do the following:
 *      - Call ECDSA_init() to initialize the driver
 *      - Call ECDSA_Params_init() to initialize the ECDSA_Params to default
 *        values.
 *      - Modify the ECDSA_Params as desired
 *      - Call ECDSA_open() to open an instance of the driver
 *
 * ## Signing a message #
 * To sign a message using an agreed upon hash function and elliptic curve, the
 * application must do the following:
 *  - Initialize an ECDSA_OperationSign struct by calling
 *    ECDSA_OperationSign_init().
 *  - Generate the keying material for the private key. This keying material
 *    must be an integer in the interval [1, n - 1], where n is the order of the
 *    curve. It should be stored in an array with the least significant byte of
 *    the integer hex representation stored in the highest address of the array
 *    (big-endian).
 *    The array should be the same length as the curve parameters of the curve
 *    used. The driver validates public and private keys against the provided
 *    curve.
 *  - Initialize the private key CryptoKey. CryptoKeys are opaque datastructures
 *    and representations of keying material and its storage.
 *    Depending on how the keying material is stored (RAM or flash, key store),
 *    the CryptoKey must be initialized differently.
 *    The ECDSA API can handle all types of CryptoKey.
 *    However, not all device-specific implementions support all types of
 *    CryptoKey.
 *    Devices without a key store will not support CryptoKeys with keying
 *    material stored in a key store for example.
 *    All devices support plaintext CryptoKeys.
 *  - Hash the message using a previously agreed upon hash function and truncate
 *    the hash to the length of the curve parameters of the agreed upon curve.
 *  - Call  ECDSA_sign(). The r and s vectors will be written to the buffers
 *    provided in the function call. Ensure the return value is
 *    ECDSA_STATUS_SUCCESS.
 *
 * ## Verifying a message #
 * After receiving the message, public key, r, and s, the application should
 * do the following to verify the signature:
 *  - Initialize an ECDSA_OperationVerify struct by calling
 *    ECDSA_OperationVerify_init().
 *  - Hash the message using a previously agreed upon hash function and truncate
 *    the hash to the length of the curve parameters of the agreed upon curve.
 *  - Initialize a CryptoKey as public key with the keying material received
 *    from the other party.
 *  - Call ECDSA_verify(). Ensure the return value is ECDSA_STATUS_SUCCESS. The
 *    driver will validate the received public key against the provided curve.
 *
 * ## General usage #
 * The API expects elliptic curves as defined in
 * ti/drivers/cryptoutils/ecc/ECCParams.h.
 * Several commonly used curves are provided. Check the device-specific ECDSA
 * documentation
 * for curve type (short Weierstrass, Montgomery, Edwards) support for your
 * device.
 * ECDSA support for a curve type on a device does not imply curve-type support
 * for other ECC schemes.
 *
 * ## Parameter formatting #
 * Public keys are points on an elliptic curve. These points can
 * be expressed in several ways. The most common one is in affine coordinates as
 * an X,Y pair.
 * This API uses points expressed in uncompressed affine coordinates by default
 * and formatted in octet string format.
 * The octet string format requires a formatting byte in the first byte of the
 * public key. When using uncompressed coordinates, this is the value
 * 0x04.
 * The point itself is stored as a concatenated array of X followed by Y.
 * X and Y are big-endian.
 *
 * This API accepts and returns the keying material of public keys according
 * to the following table:
 *
 * | Curve Type         | PublicKeying Material Array | Array Length         |
 * |--------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|
 * | Short Weierstrass  | [0x04, X, Y]          | 1 + 2 * Curve Param Length |
 * | Montgomery         | [0x04, X, Y]          | 1 + 2 * Curve Param Length |
 * | Edwards            | [0x04, X, Y]          | 1 + 2 * Curve Param Length |
 *
 * The signature components r and s as well as the hash must be formatted in
 * octet string format. For the hash, this simply means passing the digest of
 * the hash function such as SHA-256 directly into #ECDSA_sign() or
 * #ECDSA_verify(). r and s will be interpreted as big-endian integers.

/**
 *  @brief  Constructs a new ECDSA object
 *
 *  Unlike #ECDSA_open(), #ECDSA_construct() does not require the hwAttrs and
 *  object to be allocated in a #ECDSA_Config array that is indexed into.
 *  Instead, the #ECDSA_Config, hwAttrs, and object can be allocated at any
 *  location. This allows for relatively simple run-time allocation of temporary
 *  driver instances on the stack or the heap.
 *  The drawback is that this makes it more difficult to write device-agnostic
 *  code. If you use an ifdef with DeviceFamily, you can choose the correct
 *  object and hwAttrs to allocate. That compilation unit will be tied to the
 *  device it was compiled for at this point. To change devices, recompilation
 *  of the application with a different DeviceFamily setting is necessary.
 *
 *  @param  config #ECDSA_Config describing the location of the object
 *                 and hwAttrs.
 *
 *  @param  params #ECDSA_Params to configure the driver instance.
 *
 *  @return        Returns a #ECDSA_Handle on success or NULL on failure.
 *
 *  @pre    The object struct @c config points to must be zeroed out prior to
 *          calling this function. Otherwise, unexpected behavior may ensue.
