 *  @brief      UART driver implementation for a CC26X2 UART controller
 *
 *  The UART header file should be included in an application as follows:

 *  #include <ti/drivers/UART2.h>
 *  #include <ti/drivers/uart2/UART2CC26X2.h>
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  Refer to @ref UART2.h for a complete description of APIs and examples
 *  of use.
 *
 * # Unsupported Functionality #
 * The UART2 driver is unable to access flash memory in the address range 0x0000 - 0x2000
 * on devices based on the Cortex M33+ core (CC26X3/CC26X4) due to security constraints.

 *  @brief      UART2CC26X2 Hardware attributes
 *
 *  The fields, baseAddr and intNum are used by driverlib
 *  APIs and therefore must be populated by
 *  driverlib macro definitions. These definitions are found under the
 *  device family in:
 *      - inc/hw_memmap.h
 *      - inc/hw_ints.h
 *      - driverlib/uart.h
 *
 *  intPriority is the UART peripheral's interrupt priority, as defined by the
 *  underlying OS.  It is passed unmodified to the underlying OS's interrupt
 *  handler creation code, so you need to refer to the OS documentation
 *  for usage.  For example, for SYS/BIOS applications, refer to the
 *  ti.sysbios.family.arm.m3.Hwi documentation for SYS/BIOS usage of
 *  interrupt priorities.  If the driver uses the ti.dpl interface
 *  instead of making OS calls directly, then the HwiP port handles the
 *  interrupt priority in an OS specific way.  In the case of the SYS/BIOS
 *  port, intPriority is passed unmodified to Hwi_create().
 *  The CC26x2 uses three of the priority bits, meaning ~0 has the same
 *  effect as (7 << 5).
 *
 *        (7 << 5) will apply the lowest priority.
 *        (1 << 5) will apply the highest priority.
 *
 *  Setting the priority to 0 is not supported by this driver.  HWI's with
 *  priority 0 ignore the HWI dispatcher to support zero-latency interrupts,
 *  thus invalidating the critical sections in this driver.
 *
 *  A sample structure is shown below:
 *  @code
 *  const UART2CC26X2_HWAttrs uartCC26X2HWAttrs[] = {
 *      {
 *          .baseAddr     = UARTA0_BASE,
 *          .intNum       = INT_UART0_COMB,
 *          .intPriority  = (~0),
 *          .flowControl  = UART2_FLOWCTRL_NONE,
 *          .rxPin        = IOID_2,
 *          .txPin        = IOID_3,
 *          .ctsPin       = GPIO_INVALID_INDEX,
 *          .rtsPin       = GPIO_INVALID_INDEX,
 *          .rxChannelMask  = 1 << UDMA_CHAN_UART0_RX,
 *          .txChannelMask  = 1 << UDMA_CHAN_UART0_TX,
 *          .txIntFifoThr = UART2CC26X2_FIFO_THRESHOLD_1_8,
 *          .rxIntFifoThr = UART2CC26X2_FIFO_THRESHOLD_4_8,
 *      },
 *      {
 *          .baseAddr     = UART1_BASE,
 *          .intNum       = INT_UART1_COMB,
 *          .intPriority  = (~0),
 *          .flowControl  = UART2_FLOWCTRL_NONE,
 *          .rxPin        = GPIO_INVALID_INDEX,
 *          .txPin        = GPIO_INVALID_INDEX,
 *          .ctsPin       = GPIO_INVALID_INDEX,
 *          .rtsPin       = GPIO_INVALID_INDEX,
 *          .rxChannelMask  = 1 << UDMA_CHAN_UART1_RX,
 *          .txChannelMask  = 1 << UDMA_CHAN_UART1_TX,
 *          .txIntFifoThr = UART2CC26X2_FIFO_THRESHOLD_1_8,
 *          .rxIntFifoThr = UART2CC26X2_FIFO_THRESHOLD_4_8,
 *      },
 *  };
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  To enable flow control, the .ctsPin and/or .rtsPin must be assigned.
 *  In addition, .flowControl must be set to UART2_FLOWCTRL_HARDWARE.
