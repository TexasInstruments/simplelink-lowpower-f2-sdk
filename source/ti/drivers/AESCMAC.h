 *  @brief      AESCMAC (CMAC and CBC-MAC) driver header
 *
 *  @anchor ti_drivers_AESCMAC_Overview
 *  # Overview #
 *  The Cipher-based Message Authentication Code (CMAC) and Cipher Block Chaining
 *  Message Authentication Code (CBC-MAC) are generic block cipher modes of
 *  operation. They can be used with any block cipher but this driver
 *  implementation uses AES.
 *
 *  Both CMAC and CBC-MAC create a message authentication code from a message of
 *  any practical length to provide authenticity and integrity assurances.
 *  CMAC is recommended over CBC-MAC because CBC-MAC is not secure for variable
 *  length messages.
 *
 *  ## CBC-MAC Drawbacks #
 *  CBC-MAC is only secure for fixed-length messages. Any single key must only be
 *  used for messages of a fixed and known length. The CMAC algorithm, which
 *  is based on a variation of CBC-MAC at its core, was developed to address that
 *  security deficiency and is the MAC algorithm recommended by NIST.

 *  # CMAC Usage #
 *  ## Before starting a CMAC operation #
 *
 *  Before starting a CMAC operation, the application must do the following:
 *      - Call #AESCMAC_init() to initialize the driver
 *      - Call #AESCMAC_Params_init() to initialize the #AESCMAC_Params to default values.
 *      - Modify the #AESCMAC_Params as desired
 *      - Call #AESCMAC_open() to open an instance of the driver
 *      - Initialize a CryptoKey. These opaque data structures are representations
 *        of keying material and its storage. Depending on how the keying material
 *        is stored (RAM or flash, key store), the CryptoKey must be
 *        initialized differently. The CMAC API can handle all types of CryptoKey.
 *        However, not all device-specific implementations support all types of CryptoKey.
 *        Devices without a key store will not support CryptoKeys with keying material
 *        stored in a key store for example.
 *        All devices support plaintext CryptoKeys.
 *
 *  ## Device-Specific Requirements #
 *
 *  For CC27XX devices, CMAC operations leveraging the HSM engine
 *  (key encoding suffixed with _HSM) have the following requirements:
 *      - Input length must be a block-size (16-byte) multiple.
 *
 *  ## Starting a CMAC operation #
 *
 *  The #AESCMAC_oneStepSign and #AESCMAC_oneStepVerify functions perform a CMAC operation
 *  in a single call. They will always be the most highly optimized routines with the
 *  least overhead and the fastest runtime. However, they require all plaintext
 *  or ciphertext to be available to the function at the start of the call.
 *  All devices support single call operations.
 *
 *  ## After the CMAC operation completes #
 *
 *  After the CMAC operation completes, the application should either start
 *  another operation or close the driver by calling #AESCMAC_close().

 *  ## Before starting a CBC-MAC operation #
 *
 *  Before starting a CBC-MAC operation, the application must do the following:
 *  - Call #AESCMAC_init() to initialize the driver
 *  - Call #AESCMAC_Params_init() to initialize the #AESCMAC_Params to
 *    default values.
 *  - Set #AESCMAC_Params.operationalMode to #AESCMAC_OPMODE_CBCMAC.
 *  - Modify the #AESCMAC_Params as desired
 *    - Call #AESCMAC_open() to open an instance of the driver
 *    - Initialize a CryptoKey. These opaque data structures are representations
 *      of keying material and its storage. Depending on how the keying material
 *      is stored (RAM or flash, key store, key blob), the CryptoKey must be
 *      initialized differently. The AESCMAC API can handle all types of
 *      CryptoKey. However, not all device-specific implementations support all
 *      types of CryptoKey. Devices without a key store will not support
 *      CryptoKeys with keying material stored in a key store for example. All
 *      devices support plaintext CryptoKeys.
 *  - Initialize the #AESCMAC_Operation using #AESCMAC_Operation_init()
 *    and set all length, key, and buffer fields.
 *
 *  ## Starting a CBC-MAC operation #
 *
 *  The #AESCMAC_oneStepSign and #AESCMAC_oneStepVerify functions perform a
 *  CBC-MAC operation in a single call. They will always be the most highly
 *  optimized routines with the least overhead and the fastest runtime. However,
 *  they require all plaintext or ciphertext to be available to the function at
 *  the start of the call. All devices support single call operations.
 *
 *  ## After the CBC-MAC operation completes #
 *
 *  After the CBC-MAC operation completes, the application should either start
 *  another operation or close the driver by calling #AESCMAC_close().

/**
 *  @brief  Constructs a new AESCMAC object
 *
 *  Unlike #AESCMAC_open(), #AESCMAC_construct() does not require the hwAttrs and
 *  object to be allocated in a #AESCMAC_Config array that is indexed into.
 *  Instead, the #AESCMAC_Config, hwAttrs, and object can be allocated at any
 *  location. This allows for relatively simple run-time allocation of temporary
 *  driver instances on the stack or the heap.
 *  The drawback is that this makes it more difficult to write device-agnostic
 *  code. If you use an ifdef with DeviceFamily, you can choose the correct
 *  object and hwAttrs to allocate. That compilation unit will be tied to the
 *  device it was compiled for at this point. To change devices, recompilation
 *  of the application with a different DeviceFamily setting is necessary.
 *
 *  @note   #AESCMAC_Params @a operationalMode may be set to
 *          enable CBC-MAC mode but the default is CMAC mode
 *
 *  @pre    The object struct @c config points to must be zeroed out prior to
 *          calling this function. Otherwise, unexpected behavior may ensue.
 *
 *  @param [in] config #AESCMAC_Config describing the location of the object and hwAttrs.
 *
 *  @param [in] params #AESCMAC_Params to configure the driver instance.
 *
 *  @return     Returns a #AESCMAC_Handle on success or NULL on failure.
