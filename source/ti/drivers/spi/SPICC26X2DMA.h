 *
 *  @brief      SPI driver implementation for a CC26XX SPI controller using
 *              the UDMA controller.
 *
 * # Driver include #
 *  The SPI header file should be included in an application as follows:
 *  @code
 *  #include <ti/drivers/SPI.h>
 *  #include <ti/drivers/spi/SPICC26X2DMA.h>
 *  #include <ti/drivers/dma/UDMACC26XX.h>
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  Refer to @ref SPI.h for a complete description of APIs.
 *
 * Note that the user also needs to include the UDMACC26XX.h driver since the
 * SPI uses uDMA in order to improve throughput.
 *
 * # Overview #
 * The general SPI API should be used in application code, i.e. SPI_open()
 * should be used instead of SPICC26X2DMA_open(). The board file will define the device
 * specific config, and casting in the general API will ensure that the correct
 * device specific functions are called.
 * This is also reflected in the example code in [Use Cases](@ref USE_CASES_SPI_X2).
 *
 * # General Behavior #
 * Before using SPI on CC26XX:
 *   - The SPI driver is initialized by calling SPI_init().
 *   - The SPI HW is configured and flags system dependencies (e.g. IOs,
 *     power, etc.) by calling SPI_open().
 *   - The SPI driver makes use of DMA in order to optimize throughput.
 *     This is handled directly by the SPI driver, so the application should never
 *     to make any calls directly to the UDMACC26XX.h driver.
 *   - This implementation supports queueing multiple transactions in callback
 *     mode. See the @ref USE_CASE_QUEUE "queueing example."
 *   - When queueing multiple transactions that should transfer one after the
 *     other, it is recommended to use the driver in 'manual start' mode by using
 *     the #SPICC26X2DMA_CMD_SET_MANUAL command. In this mode, the driver will
 *     not start any queued transfers until SPI_control() is called with the
 *     #SPICC26X2DMA_CMD_MANUAL_START command. This mode is off by default and
 *     can be disabled by using command #SPICC26X2DMA_CMD_CLR_MANUAL. See the
 *     @ref USE_CASE_MANUAL_START "Manual Start Example".
 *
 * The following is true for peripheral operation:
 *   - RX overrun IRQ, SPI and UDMA modules are enabled by calling SPI_transfer().
 *   - All received bytes are ignored after SPI_open() is called, until
 *     the first SPI_transfer().
 *   - If an RX overrun occur or if SPI_transferCancel() is called, RX overrun IRQ, SPI and UDMA
 *     modules are disabled, TX and RX FIFOs are flushed and all bytes are ignored.
 *   - After a successful transfer, RX overrun IRQ and SPI module remains enabled and UDMA module is disabled.
 *     SPI_transfer() must be called again before RX FIFO goes full in order to
 *     avoid overflow. If the TX buffer is underflowed, zeros will be output.
 *     It is safe to call another SPI_transfer() from the transfer callback,
 *     see [Continuous Peripheral Transfer] (@ref USE_CASE_CST_X2) use case below.
 *   - The SPI driver supports partial return, that can be used if the
 *     transfer size is unknown. If #SPICC26X2DMA_CMD_RETURN_PARTIAL_ENABLE is
 *     passed to SPI_control(), the transfer will end when chip select is
 *     deasserted. The #SPI_Transaction.status and the #SPI_Transaction.count
 *     will be updated to indicate whether the transfer ended due to a chip
 *     select deassertion and how many bytes were transferred. See
 *     [Peripheral Mode With Return Partial] (@ref USE_CASE_RP_X2) use case below.
 *   - When queueing several transactions if the first is a 'short'
 *     transaction (8 or fewer frames), it is required to use
 *     @ref USE_CASE_MANUAL_START "Manual Start mode."
 *
 * @warning The SPI modules on the CC13x0, CC26x0, and CC26x0R2 devices have a
 *     bug which may result in TX data being lost when operating in SPI peripheral
 *     mode. Please refer to the device errata sheet for full details. The SPI
 *     protocol should therefore include a data integrity check, such as
 *     appending a CRC to the payload to ensure all the data was transmitted
 *     correctly by the SPI peripheral.
 *
 * The following apply for controller operation:
 *   - SPI and UDMA modules are enabled by calling SPI_transfer().
 *   - If the SPI_transfer() succeeds, SPI module is enabled and UDMA module is disabled.
 *   - If SPI_transferCancel() is called, SPI and UDMA modules are disabled and
 *     TX and RX FIFOs are flushed.
 *   .
 * After SPI operation has ended:
 *   - Release system dependencies for SPI by calling SPI_close().
 *   .
 * The callback function is always called in a SWI context.
 *
 * @warning     The application should avoid transmitting data stored in flash via SPI if the application
 *              might switch to the XOSC_HF, the high frequency external oscillator, during this transfer.
 *
 * # Error handling #
 * If an RX overrun occurs during peripheral operation:
 *   - If a transfer is ongoing, all bytes received up until the error occurs will be returned, with the
 *     error signaled in the #SPI_Transaction.status field. RX overrun IRQ, SPI and UDMA modules are then disabled,
 *     TX and RX FIFOs are flushed and all bytes will be ignored until a new transfer is issued.
 *   - If a transfer is not ongoing, RX overrun IRQ, SPI and UDMA modules are disabled,
 *     TX and RX FIFOs are flushed and all bytes will be ignored until a new transfer is issued.
 *
 * # Timeout #
 * Timeout can occur in #SPI_MODE_BLOCKING, there's no timeout in #SPI_MODE_CALLBACK.
 * When in #SPI_MODE_CALLBACK, the transfer must be cancelled by calling SPI_transferCancel().@n
 * If a timeout happens in either  #SPI_PERIPHERAL or #SPI_CONTROLLER mode,
 * the receive buffer will contain the bytes received up until the timeout occurred.
 * The SPI transaction status will be set to #SPI_TRANSFER_FAILED.
 * The SPI transaction count will be set to the number of bytes sent/received before timeout.
 * The remaining bytes will be flushed from the TX FIFO so that the subsequent transfer
 * can be executed correctly. Note that specifying a timeout prevents the
 * driver from performing a polling transfer when in peripheral mode.
 *
 * # Power Management #
 * The TI-RTOS power management framework will try to put the device into the most
 * power efficient mode whenever possible. Please see the technical reference
 * manual for further details on each power mode.
 *
 *  The SPICC26X2DMA.h driver is setting a power constraint during transfers to keep
 *  the device out of standby. When the transfer has finished, the power
 *  constraint is released.
 *  The following statements are valid:
 *    - After SPI_open(): the device is still allowed to enter standby.
 *    - In peripheral mode:
 *        - During SPI_transfer(): the device cannot enter standby, only idle.
 *        - After an RX overflow: device is allowed to enter standby.
 *        - After a successful SPI_transfer(): the device is allowed
 *          to enter standby, but SPI module remains enabled.
 *            - _Note_: In peripheral mode, the device might enter standby while a byte is being
 *               transferred if SPI_transfer() is not called again after a successful
 *               transfer. This could result in corrupt data being transferred.
 *        - Application thread should typically either issue another transfer after
 *          SPI_transfer() completes successfully, or call
 *          SPI_transferCancel() to disable the SPI module and thus assuring that no data
 *          is received while entering standby.
 *        .
 *    - In controller mode:
 *        - During SPI_transfer(): the device cannot enter standby, only idle.
 *        - After SPI_transfer() succeeds: the device can enter standby.
 *        - If SPI_transferCancel() is called: the device can enter standby.
 *
 *  @note The external hardware connected to the SPI might have some pull configured on the
 *        SPI lines. When the SPI is inactive, this might cause leakage on the IO and the
 *        current consumption to increase. The application must configure a pull configuration
 *        that aligns with the external hardware.
 *        See [Ensure low power during inactive periods] (@ref USE_CASE_LPWR_X2) for code example.
 *
 *  # SPI details #
 *  ## Chip Select #
 *  This SPI controller supports a hardware chip select pin. Refer to the
 *  user manual on how this hardware chip select pin behaves in regards
 *  to the SPI frame format.
 *
 *  <table>
 *  <tr>
 *  <th>Chip select type</th>
 *  <th>SPI_CONTROLLER mode</th>
 *  <th>SPI_PERIPHERAL mode</th>
 *  </tr>
 *  <tr>
 *  <td>Hardware chip select</td>
 *  <td>No action is needed by the application to select the peripheral.</td>
 *  <td>See the device documentation on it's chip select requirements.</td>
 *  </tr>
 *  <tr>
 *  <td>Software chip select</td>
 *  <td>The application is responsible to ensure that correct SPI peripheral is
 *      selected before performing a SPI_transfer().</td>
 *  <td>See the device documentation on it's chip select requirements.</td>
 *  </tr>
 *  </table>
 *
 *  ### Multiple peripherals when operating in controller mode #
 *  In a scenario where the SPI module is operating in controller mode with multiple
 *  SPI peripherals, the chip select pin can be reallocated at runtime to select the
 *  appropriate peripheral device. See [Controller Mode With Multiple Peripherals](@ref USE_CASE_MMMS_X2) use case below.
 *  This is only relevant when chip select is a hardware chip select. Otherwise the application
 *  can control the chip select pins directly using the GPIO driver.
 *
 *  ## Data Frames #
 *
 *  SPI data frames can be any size from 4-bits to 16-bits. If the dataSize in
 *  #SPI_Params is greater that 8-bits, then the SPICC26X2DMA driver
 *  implementation will assume that the #SPI_Transaction txBuf and rxBuf
 *  point to an array of 16-bit uint16_t elements.
 *
 *  dataSize  | buffer element size |
 *  --------  | ------------------- |
 *  4-8 bits  | uint8_t             |
 *  9-16 bits | uint16_t            |
 *
 *  ## Bit Rate ##
 *  Maximum bit rate is 4MHz for both peripheral and controller modes.
 *
 *
 *  ## UDMA #
 *  ### Interrupts #
 *  The UDMA module generates IRQs on the SPI interrupt vector. This driver automatically
 *  installs a UDMA aware Hwi (interrupt) to service the assigned UDMA channels.
 *
 *  ### Transfer Size Limit #
 *
 *  The UDMA controller only supports data transfers of up to 1024 data frames.
 *  A transfer with more than 1024 frames will be transmitted/received in
 *  multiple 1024 sized portions until all data has been transmitted/received.
 *  A data frame can be 4 to 16 bits in length.
 *
 *  ### Scratch Buffers #
 *  A uint16_t scratch buffer is used to allow SPI_transfers where txBuf or rxBuf
 *  are NULL. Rather than requiring txBuf or rxBuf to have a dummy buffer of size
 *  of the transfer count, a single-word UDMA accessible uint16_t scratch buffer is used.
 *  When rxBuf is NULL, the UDMA will transfer all the received SPI data into the
 *  scratch buffer as a "bit-bucket".
 *  When txBuf is NULL, the scratch buffer is initialized to defaultTxBufValue
 *  so the uDMA will send some known value.
 *  Each SPI driver instance uses its own scratch buffer.
 *
 *  ### TX and RX buffers #
 *  Before SPI_transfer, txBuf should be filled with the outgoing SPI data. These
 *  data are sent out during the transfer, while the incoming data are received
 *  into rxBuf. To save memory space, txBuf and rxBuf can be assigned to the same
 *  buffer location. At the beginning of the transfer, this buffer holds outgoing
 *  data. At the end of the transfer, the outgoing data are overwritten and
 *  the buffer holds the received SPI data.
 *
 *  ## Polling SPI transfers #
 *  When used in blocking mode small SPI transfers are can be done by polling
 *  the peripheral & sending data frame-by-frame. A controller device can perform
 *  the transfer immediately and return, but a peripheral will block until it
 *  receives the number of frames specified in the SPI_Transfer() call.
 *  The minDmaTransferSize field in the hardware attributes is
 *  the threshold; if the transaction count is below the threshold a polling
 *  transfer is performed; otherwise a DMA transfer is done.  This is intended
 *  to reduce the overhead of setting up a DMA transfer to only send a few
 *  data frames.
 *
 *  Notes:
 *  - Specifying a timeout prevents peripheral devices from using polling transfers.
 *  - Keep in mind that during polling transfers the current task
 *  is still being executed; there is no context switch to another task.

 * ## Use Cases @anchor USE_CASES_SPI_X2 ##
 * ### Basic Peripheral Mode #
 *  Receive 100 bytes over SPI in #SPI_MODE_BLOCKING.
 *  @code
 *  SPI_Handle handle;
 *  SPI_Params params;
 *  SPI_Transaction transaction;
 *  uint8_t rxBuf[100];     // Receive buffer

 *  handle = SPI_open(CONFIG_SPI, &params);
 *  SPI_transfer(handle, &transaction);
 *  @endcode
 *
 * ### Peripheral Mode With Return Partial @anchor USE_CASE_RP_X2 #
 *  This use case will perform a transfer in #SPI_MODE_BLOCKING until the wanted
 *  amount of bytes is transferred or until chip select is deasserted by the SPI
 *  controller.
 *  This SPI_transfer() call can be used when unknown amount of bytes shall
 *  be transferred.
 *  <br> Note: Partial return is also possible in #SPI_MODE_CALLBACK mode.
 *  In callback mode, partial transfers can be queued by calling SPI_transfer()
 *  multiple times.
 *  <br> Note: Polling transfers are not available when using return partial mode.
 *  @code
 *  SPI_Handle handle;
 *  SPI_Params params;
 *  SPI_Transaction transaction;
 *  uint8_t rxBuf[100];     // Receive buffer
 *
 *  // Init SPI and specify non-default parameters
 *  SPI_Params_init(&params);
 *  params.bitRate     = 1000000;
 *  params.frameFormat = SPI_POL1_PHA1;
 *  params.mode        = SPI_PERIPHERAL;
 *
 *  // Configure the transaction
 *  transaction.count = 100;
 *  transaction.txBuf = NULL;
 *  transaction.rxBuf = rxBuf;
 *
 *  // Open the SPI and initiate the partial read
 *  handle = SPI_open(CONFIG_SPI, &params);
 *
 *  // Enable RETURN_PARTIAL
 *  SPI_control(handle, SPICC26X2DMA_RETURN_PARTIAL_ENABLE, NULL);
 *
 *  // Begin transfer
 *  SPI_transfer(handle, &transaction);
 *  @endcode
 *
 * ### Continuous Peripheral Transfer In #SPI_MODE_CALLBACK @anchor USE_CASE_CST_X2 #
 *  This use case will configure the SPI driver to transfer continuously in
 *  #SPI_MODE_CALLBACK, 16 bytes at the time and echoing received data after every
 *  16 bytes.
 *  @code
 *  // Callback function
 *  static void transferCallback(SPI_Handle handle, SPI_Transaction *transaction)
 *  {
 *      // Start another transfer
 *      SPI_transfer(handle, transaction);
 *  }
 *
 *  static void taskFxn(uintptr_t a0, uintptr_t a1)
 *  {
 *      SPI_Handle handle;
 *      SPI_Params params;
 *      SPI_Transaction transaction;
 *      uint8_t buf[16];                  // Receive and transmit buffer

 *      // Configure the transaction
 *      transaction.count = 16;
 *      transaction.txBuf = buf;
 *      transaction.rxBuf = buf;
 *
 *      // Open the SPI and initiate the first transfer
 *      handle = SPI_open(CONFIG_SPI, &params);
 *      SPI_transfer(handle, &transaction);
 *
 *      // Wait forever
 *      while(true);
 *  }
 *  @endcode
 *
 * ### Basic Controller Mode #
 *  This use case will configure a SPI controller to send the data in txBuf while receiving data to rxBuf in
 *  BLOCKING_MODE.
 *  @code
 *  SPI_Handle handle;
 *  SPI_Params params;
 *  SPI_Transaction transaction;
 *  uint8_t txBuf[] = "Hello World";    // Transmit buffer
 *  uint8_t rxBuf[11];                  // Receive buffer
 *
 *  // Init SPI and specify non-default parameters
 *  SPI_Params_init(&params);

 *
 *  // Open the SPI and perform the transfer
 *  handle = SPI_open(CONFIG_SPI, &params);
 *  SPI_transfer(handle, &transaction);
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  ### Controller Mode With Multiple Peripherals @anchor USE_CASE_MMMS_X2 #
 *  This use case will configure a SPI controller to send data to one peripheral and then to another in
 *  BLOCKING_MODE. It is assumed that the board file is configured so that the two chip select
 *  pins have a default setting of a high output and that the #SPICC26X2DMA_HWAttrs used points
 *  to one of them since the SPI driver will revert to this default setting when switching the
 *  chip select pin.
 *
 *  @code
 *  // From ti_drivers_config.c
 *  // Use the sysconfig settings to make sure both pins are set to HIGH when not in use
 *  GPIO_PinConfig gpioPinConfigs[31] = {
 *      ...
 *      GPIO_CFG_OUT_STD | GPIO_CFG_OUT_HIGH, // CONFIG_CSN_0
 *      ...
 *      GPIO_CFG_OUT_STD | GPIO_CFG_OUT_HIGH, // CONFIG_CSN_1

 *
 *      // Then switch chip select pin and perform transfer to the second peripheral
 *      SPI_control(handle, SPICC26X2DMA_SET_CSN_PIN, &csnPin1);
 *      SPI_transfer(handle, &transaction);
 *  }
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  ### Queueing Transactions in Callback Mode #
 *  @anchor USE_CASE_QUEUE
 *  Below is an example of queueing three transactions
 *  @code
 *  // SPI already opened in callback mode
 *  SPI_Transaction t0, t1, t2;
 *
 *  t0.txBuf = txBuff0;
 *  t0.rxBuf = rxBuff0;
 *  t0.count = 2000;
 *
 *  t1.txBuf = txBuff1;
 *  t1.rxBuf = rxBuff1;
 *  t1.count = 1000;
 *
 *  t2.txBuf = txBuff2;
 *  t2.rxBuf = NULL;
 *  t2.count = 1000;
 *
 *  bool transferOk = false;
 *
 *  if (SPI_transfer(spiHandle, &t0)) {
 *      if (SPI_transfer(spiHandle, &t1)) {
 *              transferOk = SPI_transfer(spiHandle, &t2);
 *          }
 *      }
 *  }
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  ### Queueing in Manual Start Mode#
 *  This example shows a peripheral device queueing two transactions that will
 *  complete one after the other. From the controller's perspective there will be
 *  one long transfer.
 *  @note Manual mode also works while the device is in #SPI_CONTROLLER mode. The
 *  control call to MANUAL_START will start the transfers.
 *
 *  @warning Manual start mode should not be enabled or disabled while a
 *  transaction is in progress.
 *
 *  @anchor USE_CASE_MANUAL_START
 *  @code
 *  SPI_Handle spi;
 *  SPI_Params params;
 *  SPI_Transaction t0, t1;
 *  uint8_t status = SPI_STATUS_SUCCESS;
 *
 *  SPI_Params_init(&params);
 *  params.mode = SPI_PERIPHERAL;
 *  spi = SPI_open(CONFIG_SPI, &params);
 *
 *  if (spi == NULL) {
 *      exit(0);
 *  }
 *
 *  // Enable manual start mode
 *  SPI_control(spi, SPICC26X2DMA_CMD_SET_MANUAL, NULL);
 *
 *  // Queue transactions
 *  t0.txBuf = txBuff0;
 *  t0.rxBuf = rxBuff0;
 *  t0.count = 2000;
 *  if (!SPI_transfer(spi, &t0)) {
 *      status = SPI_STATUS_FAIL;
 *  }
 *
 *  t1.txBuf = txBuff1;
 *  t1.rxBuf = rxBuff1;
 *  t1.count = 1000;
 *  if (!SPI_transfer(spi, &t1)) {
 *      status = SPI_STATUS_FAIL;
 *  }
 *
 *  // Enable the transfers
 *  if (status == SPI_STATUS_SUCCESS) {
 *      SPI_control(spi, SPICC26X2DMA_CMD_MANUAL_START, NULL);
 *  }
 *  else {
 *      status = SPI_STATUS_FAILURE;
 *  }
 *
 *  // At this point the peripheral is ready for the controller to start the transfer
 *  // Assume the callback implementation (not shown) posts a semaphore when
 *  // the last transaction completes
 *  sem_wait(&spiSemaphore);

 *  ### Ensure low power during inactive periods @anchor USE_CASE_LPWR_X2 #
 *  External hardware connected on the SPI, i.e. SPI host/peripheral, might have configured
 *  a pull on one or more of the SPI lines. Dependent on the hardware, it might conflict
 *  with the pull used for the CC26XX SPI. To avoid increased leakage and ensure the lowest
 *  possible power consumption when the SPI is inactive, the application must configure a
 *  matching pull on the SPI IOs. An example of how this can be done is shown below.
 *
 *  @code
 *  SPI_Params params;
 *  SPI_Transaction transaction;
 *  uint8_t txBuf[] = "Heartbeat";    // Transmit buffer
 *  uint8_t rxBuf[9];                 // Receive buffer
 *  uint32_t standbyDurationMs = 100;
 *
 *  // Init SPI and specify non-default parameters
 *  SPI_Params_init(&params);
 *  params.bitRate     = 1000000;
 *  params.frameFormat = SPI_POL1_PHA1;
 *  params.mode        = SPI_CONTROLLER;
 *
 *  // Configure the transaction
 *  transaction.count = sizeof(txBuf);
 *  transaction.txBuf = txBuf;
 *  transaction.rxBuf = rxBuf;
 *
 *  // Open the SPI and perform the transfer
 *  handle = SPI_open(CONFIG_SPI_0, &params);
 *
 *  // Apply low power sleep pull config for POCI
 *  GPIO_setConfig(CONFIG_GPIO_SPI_0_POCI, GPIO_CFG_IN_PU);
 *
 *  // Do forever
 *  while(1) {
 *    // Transfer data
 *    SPI_transfer(handle, &transaction);
 *    // Sleep
 *    Task_sleep(standbyDurationMs*100);
 *  }
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  ### Wake Up On Chip Select Deassertion In Peripheral Mode Using #SPI_MODE_CALLBACK #
 *  This example demonstrates using a GPIO callback on Chip Select to wake up the device
 *  to allow low power modes while waiting for a chip select edge.
 *
 *  In sysconfig or the board file, the CSN GPIO should be configured
 *  as input/pull up with an interrupt on falling edge. Otherwise, SPI_close()
 *  will reset the pin to the wrong settings and you may see line glitches.
 *
 *  *Note: The SPI controller must allow enough time between deasserting the chip select and the
 *  start of the transaction for the SPI peripheral to wake up and open up the SPI driver.
 *
 *  @code
 *  // Global variables
 *  SPI_Handle spiHandle
 *  SPI_Params spiParams;
 *  SPI_Transaction spiTransaction;
 *  const uint8_t transferSize = 8;
 *  uint8_t txBuf[8];
 *
 *  // Chip select callback
 *  static void chipSelectCallback(uint_least8_t)
 *  {
 *      // Open SPI driver, which will override any previous GPIO configuration
 *      spiHandle = SPI_open(CONFIG_SPI, &spiParams);
 *      // Issue the transfer
 *      SPI_transfer(spiHandle, &spiTransaction);
 *  }
 *
 *  // SPI transfer callback
 *  static void transferCallback(SPI_Handle handle, SPI_Transaction *transaction)
 *  {
 *      // Close the SPI driver
 *      SPI_close(handle);
 *
 *      // Note: SPI_close() will reset the pin configuration, so it is important to
 *      // set the default values correctly in sysconfig. We just need to set the
 *      // callback and enable the falling edge interrupt
 *
 *      GPIO_setCallback(CS_PIN_INDEX, chipSelectCallback);
 *      GPIO_enableInt(CS_PIN_INDEX);
 *  }
 *
 *  // From your_application.c
 *  static void taskFxn(uintptr_t a0, uintptr_t a1)
 *  {
 *      uint8_t i;
 *
 *      // Setup SPI params
 *      SPI_Params_init(&spiParams);
 *      spiParams.bitRate     = 1000000;
 *      spiParams.frameFormat = SPI_POL1_PHA1;
 *      spiParams.mode        = SPI_PERIPHERAL;
 *      spiParams.dataSize    = transferSize;
 *      spiParams.transferMode = SPI_MODE_CALLBACK;
 *      spiParams.transferCallbackFxn = transferCallback;
 *
 *      // Setup SPI transaction
 *      spiTransaction.arg = NULL;
 *      spiTransaction.count = transferSize;
 *      spiTransaction.txBuf = txBuf;
 *      spiTransaction.rxBuf = txBuf;
 *
 *      // First echo message
 *      for (i = 0; i < transferSize; i++) {
 *          txBuf[i] = i;
 *      }
 *
 *      // Configure chip select callback
 *      GPIO_setCallback(CS_PIN_INDEX, chipSelectCallback);
 *      GPIO_enableInt(CS_PIN_INDEX);
 *
 *      // Wait forever
 *      while(true);
 *  }

 *  intPriority is the SPI peripheral's interrupt priority, as defined by the
