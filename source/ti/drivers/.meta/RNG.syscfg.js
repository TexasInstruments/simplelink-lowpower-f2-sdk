The [__RNG driver__][1] generates random data of variable
lengths from a pool of entropy. The pool of entropy is maintained by the
driver using implementation-specific sources of entropy.
The output is suitable for applications requiring cryptographically
random data such as keying material for private or symmetric keys.
