 * @brief Run an initialization function at boot at specified priority
 *
 * @details This macro lets you run a function at system boot.
 *
 * @param _init_fn Pointer to the boot function to run
 *
 * @param _level The initialization level at which configuration occurs.
 * Must be one of the following symbols, which are listed in the order
 * they are performed by the kernel:
 * \n
 * \li PRE_KERNEL_1: Used for initialization objects that have no dependencies,
 * such as those that rely solely on hardware present in the processor/SOC.
 * These objects cannot use any kernel services during configuration, since
 * they are not yet available.
 * \n
 * \li PRE_KERNEL_2: Used for initialization objects that rely on objects
 * initialized as part of the PRE_KERNEL_1 level. These objects cannot use any
 * kernel services during configuration, since they are not yet available.
 * \n
 * \li POST_KERNEL: Used for initialization objects that require kernel services
 * during configuration.
 * \n
 * \li POST_KERNEL_SMP: Used for initialization objects that require kernel
 * services during configuration after SMP initialization.
 * \n
 * \li APPLICATION: Used for application components (i.e. non-kernel components)
 * that need automatic configuration. These objects can use all services
 * provided by the kernel during configuration.
 *
 * @param _prio The initialization priority of the object, relative to
 * other objects of the same initialization level. Specified as an integer
 * value in the range 0 to 99; lower values indicate earlier initialization.
 * Must be a decimal integer literal without leading zeroes or sign (e.g. 32),
 * or an equivalent symbolic name (e.g. \#define MY_INIT_PRIO 32); symbolic
 * expressions are *not* permitted
 * (e.g. CONFIG_KERNEL_INIT_PRIORITY_DEFAULT + 5).
