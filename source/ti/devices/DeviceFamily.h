 *  @brief      Infrastructure to select correct driverlib path and identify devices
 *
 *  This module enables the selection of the correct driverlib path for the current
 *  device. It also facilitates the use of per-device conditional compilation
 *  to enable minor variations in drivers between devices.
 *
 *  In order to use this functionality, DeviceFamily_XYZ must be defined as one of
 *  the supported values. The DeviceFamily_ID and DeviceFamily_DIRECTORY defines
 *  are set based on DeviceFamily_XYZ.
